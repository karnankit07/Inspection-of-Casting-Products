# Inspection-of-Casting-Products

# What is casting?
Casting is a manufacturing process in which a liquid material is poured into a mold which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify.

#Types of casting defects:
There are many types of defect in casting like blow hole, pin hole, burr, shrinkage defects, mold material defects, pouring metal defects, metallurgical defects, etc.

#Objective of this project:
The objective of this project is to automate the process of finding defects in the casting process. A casting defect is an undesired irregularity in the metal product. For removing this defective product all industries have their quality inspection department. But the main problem is that this inspection process is carried out manually. It is a very time consuming process and due to human error the process of rejecting defects is not 100% accurate.This can be the cause of rejection of an entire order which would lead to huge losses. Our model will try to eliminate this loss of revenue and make the QC process as accurate as possible.

#Type of data:
The problem is an image classification problem. I have a train dataset having 6,633 images and test dataset of 715 images.

I had done model building with the help of Convolutional Neural Network
